    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><i>Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecak recipe! Paired with a buttery graham
        cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.</i></p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>Graham Cracker Crust</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups(180g) <strong>graham cracker crumbs</strong>
        (about 12 full-sheet graham crackers)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
        <li>5 Tablespoons (71g) <strong>unsalted butter</strong>, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cheesecake</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>32 ounces (904g) full-fat brick <strong>cream cheese</strong>, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
        <li>1 cup (240g) full-fat <strong>sour cream</strong>, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon <strong>pure vanilla extract</strong></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons <strong>fresh lemon juice</strong> (optional, but recommended)</li>
        <li>3 large <strong>eggs</strong>, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Make the crust:</strong> If you're starting out with full graham crackers, use a food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in the sugar until combined, and then stir in the melted butter. Mixture will be sandy. Try to smash/break up any large chunks. Pour into an ungreased <strong>9-inch</strong> or <strong>10-inch</strong> springform pan. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and partly up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the mixture is no longer crumby/crumbly (you can use the flat bottom of a small measuring cup to help smooth it out if needed). Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside while you prepare the filling.</li>
    <br>
        <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice and beat until fully combined. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just combined. Stop the mixer as soon as the final egg is fully incorporated into the batter; over-mixing can cause the cheesecake to deflate. You will have nearly 6 cups of batter.</li>
    <br>
        <li><strong>Prepare the simple water bath:</strong>Boil a kettle/pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap 1 or 2 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil around the springform pan—be careful if it's still warm from baking the crust! Place the wrapped springform pan inside of a large roasting pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a spatula to smooth it into an even layer. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in—whichever is easier for you.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake the cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. If you notice the cheesecake browning too quickly on top, tent it with aluminum foil halfway through baking. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake should still slightly wobble if you gently tap or shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. With the door ajar, let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. After 1 hour, remove from the oven and water bath, discard the foil, and place the springform pan on a cooling rack to cool completely at room temperature. When it has cooled, cover and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Run a knife around the edges of the springform pan to help loosen the cheesecake, then remove the outer rim. Using a sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip it into warm water between each slice.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>

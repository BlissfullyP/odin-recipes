    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><i>These are chewy, fudgy, and ultra-rich brownies covered in a generous layer of creamy chocolate buttercream. The recipe starts with a combo of melted butter and quality chocolate, which provides a smooth and velvety base for these dense fudge-like treats. Bake these in a 9-inch square pan, then cool for about 1 to 2 hours before frosting.</i></p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g)<strong>unsalted butter</strong></li>
        <li>two 4-ounce (226g)<strong> semi-sweet chocolate bars</strong>, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) packed light or dark <strong>brown sugar</strong></li>
        <li>3 large <strong>eggs</strong></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon <strong>pure vanilla extract</strong></li>
        <li>2/3 cup (84g) <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons (10g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process <strong>cocoa powder</strong></li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
        <li>1 cup (180g) <strong>semi-sweet chocolate chips</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Chocolate Frosting</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) <strong>unsalted butter</strong>, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups (180g) <strong>confectioners’ sugar</strong></li>
        <li>1/3 cup (27g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process <strong>cocoa powder</strong></li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons (45ml) <strong>heavy cream</strong> or <strong>milk</strong>, slightly warm</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon <strong>pure vanilla extract</strong></li>
        <li>pinch of <strong>salt</strong>, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the brownies:</strong> Cut the butter into smaller pieces so it melts down quicker. Place it in a heatproof bowl or in a medium saucepan. Add the chopped chocolate. Melt in the microwave in 20-second increments stirring after each until melted, or, if you’re using a saucepan, melt it over low heat on the stove. Cool for just 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line the bottom and sides of a <strong>9-inch square baking pan</strong> with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk the granulated and brown sugars into the cooled chocolate/butter mixture. Whisk in the eggs, and then the vanilla. Whisk in the flour, cocoa powder, and salt until no pockets of dry ingredients remain. Once combined, fold in the chocolate chips. The batter is semi-thick.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour and spread batter evenly into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 32-35 minutes, or until the top appears set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist (not wet) crumbs. All ovens are different, so keep an eye on your brownies. Check them at 30 minutes. Mine usually take 32 minutes. <em>Tip: Err on the side of underbaking, because brownies continue to set as they cool.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the pan on a wire rack and cool brownies for 1 to 2 hours. Once cooled, lift the brownies out of the pan using the parchment paper on the sides. Set aside as you make the frosting.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Make the frosting:</strong> With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, heavy cream/milk, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Taste. Beat in another pinch of salt if desired.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread over mostly cooled brownies (it’s ok if the brownies are still a bit warm). I usually use an <strong>offset spatula</strong> to spread the frosting. Cut into squares. For neat squares, I use a very long and sharp knife and wipe it clean with a paper towel after each cut.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Unfrosted brownies stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 week. Frosted brownies stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
